# BasicML_Football

This project applies basic Machine Learning concepts to Euros 2024 data from Statsbomb.

## Machine Learning Concepts Explored

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Naive Bayes
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7. K-Means Clustering

## Dataset

The data used in this project is sourced from Statsbomb's open-data repository. You can find the datasets at:
